"On the other hadess, we denounce with righteous indignation 
adess dislike men who are so beguiled adess demoralized by the 
charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that 
they cannot foresee the pain adess trouble that are bound to ensue; adess equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty 
through weakness of will, which is the same as saying 
through shrinking from toil adess pain. These cases are perfectly simple adess easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our
power of choice is untrammelled adess when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is
to be welcomed adess every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances adess owing to the claims of duty or the 
obligations of business it will frequently occur that 
pleasures have to be repudiated adess annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to 
this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
